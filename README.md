# Stock-Trend
I will consider the data on Google stocks and create an LSTM network for prediction. Here we have two file train and test, having its Google share prices with open, high, low, and close values for a particular day. We will use this data in our LSTM model to predict the open prices for the next 20 days.

I will also explain the parameter tuning for the model using Keras Wrappers and Randomized Search SV.
